 * Nothing to show, and nowhere to show it.

 * A JVM host has no lock screen. [isAvailable] says so rather than pretending, and the rest are
 * no-ops — shared code can call them unconditionally, which is the whole point of the capability
 * reporting its own absence instead of every caller checking the platform.
 *
 * [responses] is real so that a test can drive an action through and watch what the app does with
 * it, without a device in the loop.
