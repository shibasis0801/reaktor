/**
 * Hierarchical view state over a [ReaktorFlowGraph].
 *
 * Reaktor graphs are already hierarchical: `Graph.parentGraph` nests graphs, and `ContainerNode`
 * owns child graphs. The default flow projection collapses every level onto one canvas, which is
 * the "flattened universe" problem called out in `reaktor-graph-hierarchical-ui.md`. This view
 * state lets the renderer project a single **scope** plus its immediate children, and expand a
 * single subgraph inline on demand.
 *
 * ## Scope ids
 * Scopes are identified by the stable, path-encoded ids the layout assigns to each graph: the root
 * graph is [RootScopeId] (`"root"`), the i-th child graph (via `ContainerNode.graphs`) of a scope
 * `s` is `"s/i"`, and so on recursively (`"root/1/0"`...). These match `ReaktorGraphRegion.id` and
 * the `selectedGraphId` used by the editors, so UI selection and expansion share one identifier.
 *
 * ## Semantics
 * - The root scope's direct nodes are always laid out.
 * - Each immediate child graph renders as a **collapsed boundary summary** node (level m + 1),
 *   not its internals.
 * - A child graph is expanded inline (its own nodes, plus *its* children as collapsed summaries)
 *   only when its scope id is in [expandedScopeIds]. Expansion is recursive, so deeper levels
 *   appear one expand at a time.
 *
 * A `null` scope view (the default for `buildReaktorFlowGraph`) preserves the legacy behavior of
 * laying out every nested graph at once — kept as an explicit recursive/debug projection.
